### How can I load messages for a specific Thread or Forum Post only?

You may choose to manually load a Thread or Forum Post into Discrub's Channel Messages module by following the instruction in the [Manually Load Thread or Forum Post](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/loading_and_manipulating_messages/manually_load_thread_or_fourm_post.md) section of the docs.

By default, Discrub will not automatically include these types of Channels in the visible dropdown, hence why they must be manually added as needed.
