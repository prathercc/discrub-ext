### Where can I find a list of all calls that I've made to another User in a DM?

You'll first need to load messages using the Channel Messages or Direct Messages module, and then filter down for messages of the type **Call** (see [Quick Filtering](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/loading_and_manipulating_messages/quick_filtering.md) in the docs).

After that, you should only see those types of messages in the table, and from there you can export the messages as needed (see [Export Loaded Messages](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/loading_and_manipulating_messages/export_loaded_messages.md) in the docs).
