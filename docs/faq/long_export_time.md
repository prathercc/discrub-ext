### Exporting a Server/DM appears to be taking a long time without any visible progress, what is happening?

Exports are notorious for taking quite a long time to complete, and is dependent on your selected settings.

Exports that are set to download attachments or embedded media can take additional time, as the files will need to be individually downloaded from their source.

If its been an egregious amount of time since any progress has been made (an hour or more), it may be worth [checking your browsers console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open) for any unexpected error messages.
