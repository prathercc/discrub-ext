### Why isn't Discrub opening?

If after following the instructions in [Opening the Extension / Authentication](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/opening_the_extension_and_authentication.md), the extension window does not appear, or the button to open Discrub does not show up at all, then it may be worth checking that your browser is not blocking scripts.

Script blocking can occur due to interactions with other extensions/addons you may have installed on your browser.
