### Why am I getting a Missing Permissions error message when modifying messages?

This error message typically happens when you lack the ability to modify something in Discord.

To troubleshoot, attempt to manually modify the same item in Discord itself to ensure that you actually have permission to modify it.

**Note:** A common misconception is that Call Messages can be removed, Discord does not allow for this.

**Note:** Another users message **cannot** be removed in a DM conversation!
