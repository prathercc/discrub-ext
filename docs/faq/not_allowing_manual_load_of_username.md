### Why isn't Discrub letting me manually load a User by their username?

Users can only be manually loaded using their User ID, this can be obtained via the Discord app itself, or by following the instruction listed in the [Copy a Users ID](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/loading_and_manipulating_messages/copy_a_users_id.md) section of the docs.
