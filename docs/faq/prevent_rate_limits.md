### Discord keeps rate limiting me, how can I increase the time between deletions/edits/searches?

Review the values that you have set for **Modify Delay Seconds**, **Search Delay Seconds**. 

These settings can help prevent Discord from rate limiting you while using this extension.

See [Settings](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/settings.md) in the docs.
