## View or Delete Reactions
After loading messages in either the Channel Messages or Direct Messages module, you may see a smiley faced icon-button available for messages containing reactions.

After clicking this button a new dialog will appear which shows every emoji reaction along with every User that reacted with it.

You may simply use the red icon-button to remove the reaction from the message.
