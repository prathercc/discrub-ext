## View or Delete Attachments
After loading messages in the Channel Messages or Direct Message module, messages containing an attachment will contain an icon-button on the right side of the displayed message.

Clicking this icon-button will open a dialog where attachments can be individually viewed or removed (using the red icon-button).
