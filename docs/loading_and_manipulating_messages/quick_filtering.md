## Quick Filtering
After you've loaded messages in either the Channel Messages or Direct Messages module, you will see a button called Quick Filtering.

This button allows you to perform additional filtering to the already loaded messages, typically filtering that Discord does not allow for when searching messages.

The filtering options shown above are defined as follows:

 - **Inverse** - Filter for messages that do not match the defined filters below (essentially the opposite of what the other filters are set for).
 - **Message Type/Category** - Filter for messages belonging to a specific group:
	 - **Call** - Call messages.
	 - **Pinned** - Messages that are pinned.
	 - **Pin Notification** - Pin notification messages.
	 - **Reactions** - Messages containing a reaction.
	 - **Thread Starter** - Messages that start a thread.
- **Start Time** - Filter for messages that come after the specified time.
- **End Time** - Filter for messages that come before the specified time.
- **Username** - Filter for messages made by a specific User, matching the entered text.
- **Message Content** - Filter for messages that contain the entered text.
- **Attachment Name** - Filter for messages that contain an attachment with a name that contains the entered text.
- **Threads** - Filter for messages that belong to the specified thread.

**Note:** Clicking the Reset button will clear all entered filters.
