## Manually Load a Thread or Forum Post
In the Channel Messages module, select a Server and paste the ID of a Forum Post or Thread into the Channel field, followed by pressing the Enter / Return key, to manually load the channel.

**Note:** You can locate the ID of the Forum Post or Thread by right clicking it in Discord and selecting the Copy Thread ID option.

After the ID is pasted, the extension will attempt to lookup and automatically select the Channel.

Once loaded, you may click the Search button to load messages, as you would any other Channel.
