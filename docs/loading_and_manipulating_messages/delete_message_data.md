Here is an explanation for each option:

 - **Attachments** - Attempt to remove all attached files from each message.
	 - ***Note:** If no message text exists, and no attachments remain, then the entire message will be deleted.*
- **Messages** - Attempt to remove the message itself.
	- ***Note:** If it is determined that attachments will still exist for the message, expect that only the message text will be cleared, leaving any existing attached files in-place.*
- **Reactions** - Attempt to remove reactions from the specified User(s) for reactions with the specified emoji(s).

After selecting the type of data you'd like to remove, click the Delete button to begin the removal process.
