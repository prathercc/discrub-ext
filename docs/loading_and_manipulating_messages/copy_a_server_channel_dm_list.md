## Copy Server/Channel/DM List
On the Channel Messages and Direct Messages modules, it is possible to obtain a copy of the names of the respective Servers, Channels, or DMs.

On the left-hand side of the selection field, there exists an icon-button that when pressed, will copy the list to your clipboard (which can then be pasted where needed).
