## Tags
After entering the Tags module, you can select a Server and Channel to generate mention data from (in CSV format).

Select a **Tags Starting From** and **Tags Ending On** time to create the time span in which mentions should be collected from.

Determine whether you'd like tags from replies to be included in the resulting data set.
