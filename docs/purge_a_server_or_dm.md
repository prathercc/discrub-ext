A new dialog will then be opened where the following hyperlinks become relevant:

 - [Configure Criteria](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/configuring_the_search_criteria.md)
 - [Tweak Settings](https://github.com/prathercc/discrub-ext/blob/development/docs/settings.md)
 
 After setting the desired criteria and adjusting the extension settings as needed, proceed to the Purge tab and press the Purge button.
 
**Note:** At least one User is required to be selected under the Criteria tab, in order for the Purge button to be enabled.

After pressing the Purge button, the process will begin and messages (or just reactions) will have removal attempts made, based on the entered criteria and settings.
