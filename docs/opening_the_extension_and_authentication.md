## Opening The Extension / Authentication

#### Two Ways to Open Discrub
1) Pressing the icon-button, located within the Discord web application, top right of screen:

2) Pressing the browser extension button:

Clicking on either of the two buttons should open the Discrub dialog.

#### Successful Authentication
If the extension was successfully able to locate a session, you should see a screen that looks similar to the following:

#### Failure to Authenticate
If the extension was unable to find a session, then you may see a prompt to provide an Authentication Token, to manually load a session.

If you can locate your Authentication Token, or you already have a token that you'd like to use, you may paste it into the designated field.

**Note**: It is possible to intentionally/accidentally see this screen by first opening your browser's [Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open) before attempting to open Discrub.

Another possible  reason why the extension may not be able to find a session is because you are not logged into Discord.
