## Configuring the Search Criteria
After navigating to either the Channel Messages or Direct Messages module, you may **optionally** set some search criteria to apply to your search.

**Note:** While useful to use, opting to set criteria here can slow down searches significantly due to throttling performed by Discord itself.

**Note:** Search Criteria is also available via the Export and Purge dialog, and **will impact** the messages discovered while performing exports or purges.
